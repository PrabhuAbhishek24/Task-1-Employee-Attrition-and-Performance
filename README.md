1. Data Cleaning (Excel)
Platform: Microsoft Excel
Process: Use Excel to clean and preprocess the data by:
Handling missing values (imputation or deletion).
Removing duplicates.
Correcting data formats (e.g., dates, numeric fields).
Creating new columns (e.g., tenure, performance categories).
Example Steps:
Open the CSV file in Excel.
Check for missing values using the Filter function.
Use Conditional Formatting to identify any anomalies.
Use Data Validation to ensure data consistency.
2. Data Extraction (SQL)
Platform: SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Process: Extract relevant data from databases using SQL queries.
Connect to your HR database.
Write SQL queries to extract employee data based on specific conditions (e.g., employees who have left the company).

3. Data Analysis (Python)
Platform: Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Process: Analyze the data to understand attrition patterns, predict future trends, and optimize talent utilization.

4. Report Generation (Excel/Python)
Platform: Excel/Python
Process: Summarize findings, generate reports, and visualize results.
Use Excel for final report formatting.
Use Python for generating charts and graphs.
5. Deployment and Maintenance
Platform: Depends on company infrastructure (e.g., deploying models on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).
Process: Set up a system for regular data updates and model retraining.

Summary of Required Platforms:
Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning, Report Generation.
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) - Data Extraction.
Python - Data Analysis, Modeling, Visualization.
Cloud Platforms (Optional) - For deployment and scaling.
